# Pooled-7T-Data-Processing
- Current collection of scripts here have been used to process multi-site data. 
- The scripts are written in BASH and tested on XUBUNTU 18.04 LTS. They should work on UBUNTU 18.04 LTS as well. 
- Three external tools (one Matlab, one Python on Docker, and one Python) are employed in the current processing procedure.
