# Pooled-7T-Data-Processing
- The current collection of processing scripts has been used to process multi-site data. 
- The scripts are written in BASH and tested on XUBUNTU 18.04 LTS. They should work on UBUNTU 18.04 LTS as well.
- The scripts require FSL and ANTs preinstalled via Neurodebian.
- In addition to the scripts, three external tools (one Matlab, one Python on Docker, and one Python) are employed in the current processing procedure.
  - MatLab (tested on 2019a) is required.
